# More-options sheet — feature audit + backend spec

This document is a per-feature audit of the **More options** bottom
sheet that opens from the meeting room screen, covering:

- What each option currently does on mobile
- How that compares to Google Meet
- Whether the backend supports it today (verified against
  `mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud` on **2026-05-03**)
- Backend changes needed where applicable

Audience: the dev who maintains `mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud`.

Everything that says **frontend** above is being shipped from the
mobile side in the same PR as this doc — see commits referenced at
the bottom. Everything that says **backend** needs a server change.

---

## 1. Raise hand — ✅ Working

Mobile flips `state.isHandRaised`, then emits Socket.IO event
`media-toggle` (server re-broadcasts as `media-toggle-remote`):

```json
{
  "meetingId": "<code>",
  "type": "MEDIA_TOGGLE",
  "isHandRaised": true,
  "from": "<socketId>"
}
```

Other clients show the hand badge on the participant tile.

**No backend change required.** This is identical to Google Meet's
behaviour modulo the rendering (Meet animates the hand emoji floating
upward).

---

## 2. Screen share — ⚠️ Frontend fix needed

**Current behaviour**: Mobile calls `getDisplayMedia` and tries to
hot-swap the video track on every peer connection via
`sender.replaceTrack(screenTrack)`. In SFU mode there are NO peer
connections, so the loop is a no-op — the user's local capture
starts but **other participants never see the screen**.

**Required fix (frontend)**: produce the screen track through the
SFU's send transport with `appData.isScreen: true`, mirroring what
the web client does. Code path lives in
`SFUService.produceScreen()` (already implemented, just not called
from `_startScreenShare`).

**Required fix (backend)**: none — mediasoup already accepts the
producer with `isScreen: true` in `appData`; consumers (other
peers) read that flag and render the producer in a dedicated
"presentation" tile on top of the camera tile. Verified against the
deployed web client which uses the same mechanism.

---

## 3. Captions (CC) — ✅ Working (on-device only)

Mobile uses `speech_to_text` (Android `SpeechRecognizer` / iOS
`Speech` framework) to transcribe the user's own speech locally.
Each partial transcript is broadcast over Socket.IO via
`media-toggle-remote` with `type: "CAPTION"`:

```json
{
  "meetingId": "<code>",
  "type": "CAPTION",
  "from": "<socketId>",
  "name": "<displayName>",
  "text": "hello world",
  "isFinal": false
}
```

Other clients pick this up and render rolling captions at the
bottom of the screen.

**No backend change required.** Google Meet does cloud STT (more
accurate, multi-language), but the on-device path is fine for v1
and avoids server cost. **DO NOT remove this** — the FE depends on
the backend simply re-broadcasting `media-toggle-remote` as it does
today.

---

## 4. On the go — ❌ Will be implemented frontend-only

Currently a snackbar saying "On the go mode activated" with no
behaviour. No backend involvement — Google Meet's "on-the-go" is a
local audio-first compact UI for use while moving (driving). FE
will ship this as:

- Hide the video grid
- Surface large mic / hangup / speaker buttons
- Persist preference in `SharedPreferences`

**No backend change required.**

---

## 5. In-call messages (chat) — ⚠️ Backend bug

Two delivery paths today:

### Path A — Socket.IO broadcast (✅ works)

`POST` over Socket.IO `media-toggle-remote` with `type: "CHAT"`:

```json
{
  "meetingId": "<code>",
  "type": "CHAT",
  "name": "<displayName>",
  "content": "hello",
  "from": "<socketId>",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-03T14:00:00.000Z"
}
```

This is the primary delivery channel and works correctly between
mobile and web today.

### Path B — REST persistence (❌ broken)

`POST /api/chat/send` returns **502 Bad Gateway** on the live server.
The response body is the Cloudflare error page.

Test:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud/api/chat/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"meetingId":"jhmyqrneac","senderId":"<userId>","senderName":"X","content":"probe"}'
# → HTTP/2 502
```

`GET /api/chat/<meetingId>?userId=<userId>` is also CORS-blocked
when called from `https://mizdah-front.ogoul.cloud` — the `Access-
Control-Allow-Origin` header is missing. Confirmed in browser
console during the SFU debugging session.

### Required backend changes

- Fix or restart the chat service so `POST /api/chat/send` returns
  201 Created (or 200) with the saved message body.
- Add `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://mizdah-front.ogoul.cloud`
  (or `*` if you don't restrict origins) on the `GET /api/chat/<id>`
  response so the web client can fetch chat history.

---

## 6. Participants — ✅ Working

UI shows `state.participants` plus self. Updated through the
`join-confirmation`, `user-joined`, `user-left` socket events that
the backend already emits correctly.

**No backend change required.**

---

## 7. Host Controls — ⚠️ Needs server-side verification

The mobile client emits these Socket.IO events when the host
toggles controls in the panel:

| Action | Event | Payload |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Lock meeting | `lock-meeting` | `{ "lock": true \| false }` |
| Allow mic / cam / chat | `update-settings` | `{ "key": "allowMic" \| "allowCam" \| "allowChat", "value": true \| false }` |
| Mute everyone | `mute-all` | (no payload) |
| End for all | `end-meeting-for-all` | (no payload) |

Mobile **emits** these correctly today. We have not verified that
the server side:

1. Honours `lock-meeting` by rejecting subsequent `join-meeting`
   requests with `WAITING_FOR_APPROVAL` or `JOIN_DENIED`.
2. Stores `update-settings` per meeting and applies the rule
   server-side (e.g. drops chat from a peer if `allowChat=false`).
3. On `mute-all`, broadcasts a `force-mute` event to every peer's
   socket so their mediasoup audio producer is paused.
4. On `end-meeting-for-all`, broadcasts `meeting-ended` to all
   sockets in the room. (This one we can confirm works — the
   mobile client already listens for it and tears down.)

### Required backend changes

Add server-side state for each meeting:

```sql
ALTER TABLE meetings
  ADD COLUMN locked BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  ADD COLUMN allow_mic BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  ADD COLUMN allow_cam BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true,
  ADD COLUMN allow_chat BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true;
```

Behaviour:

- `join-meeting` on a `locked` room → emit `join-denied` (or move
  to waiting room and send a `request-to-join` to the host).
- New peer joining an `allow_mic=false` room → emit `force-mute`
  to that peer immediately on join.
- `mute-all` → server fan-outs `force-mute` to every peer in the
  room AND sets `meetings.allow_mic = false` so newcomers are
  muted too.
- `update-settings` from a non-host socket → drop with an `error`
  event back to the sender.

The mobile already listens for `force-mute` and `meeting-ended`
events; new ones are noted below.

### Server → mobile events to ADD

| Event | Payload | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `force-mute` | `{ "kind": "audio" \| "video" }` | Pause the local producer client-side |
| `host-changed-permission` | `{ "key": "allowMic" \| "allowCam" \| "allowChat", "value": true \| false }` | Sync UI badge so non-host sees the lock |
| `join-denied` | `{ "reason": "room_locked" \| "host_denied" }` | Show "host has locked the meeting" snackbar instead of waiting forever |

The mobile client will be updated to handle these in a follow-up
once the backend ships them.

---

## 8. Whiteboard — ⚠️ Needs server-side verification

The mobile client emits these Socket.IO events:

| Action | Event | Payload |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Open whiteboard | `whiteboard-toggle` | `{ "isOpen": true }` |
| Stroke / shape | `draw-move` | `{ "type": "...", "points": [...], ... }` |
| Request initial state | `request-whiteboard-state` | `{}` |
| Clear board | `clear-board` | `{}` |

The mobile listens for the same events back from peers. We have
not verified that the server **re-broadcasts** these to the rest
of the room (in our SFU debugging the `onAny` log only showed
`media-toggle-remote`, `existingProducers`, `newProducer`, etc. —
none of the whiteboard events ever appeared, suggesting the server
might not be relaying them).

### Required backend changes

If not already implemented:

- Subscribe each room to a `whiteboard:<meetingCode>` channel.
- On `draw-move` from any participant, broadcast to every other
  socket in the room.
- On `request-whiteboard-state`, respond with the latest known
  state (server stores last N strokes per room — keep last 1000
  is fine).
- On `clear-board`, drop stored state and broadcast.

If you confirm this is already implemented, the FE side is ready —
nothing more to do.

---

## 9. Report abuse — ❌ Backend endpoint missing

**Current behaviour**: The submit button on the Report screen
shows a green snackbar that says "Report submitted successfully"
and pops the page. There is **no network call**. Pure UI mock.

The closest existing endpoint is `POST /api/meeting/feedback`
(used by Settings → Send Feedback) — but it returns
**405 Method Not Allowed** on the live server:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud/api/meeting/feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"category":"abuse","description":"probe","user_email":"x@y.z"}'
# → HTTP/2 405 Method Not Allowed
```

So even the Settings feedback path is broken on the server.

### Required backend changes

Either fix the existing `POST /api/meeting/feedback` (preferred,
since the FE already calls it) or add a dedicated
`POST /api/abuse/report`:

```http
POST /api/abuse/report
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "meetingId":  "<code>",          // optional — only if reported during a call
  "reporterId": "<userId>",         // who is reporting
  "subjectId":  "<userId>" | null,  // who is being reported (null for general abuse)
  "type":       "Hate speech" | "Harassment" | "Spam" | "Other",
  "names":      "alice, bob",        // free-form names typed by reporter
  "description": "Detailed text of the report",
  "includeVideoClip": true | false   // whether mobile should upload last 30s
}
```

Response:

```json
{ "status": "received", "reportId": "<uuid>" }
```

Once this exists the mobile client (already updated this PR) will
call it from the Report submit button instead of the mock
snackbar.

If a video-clip upload is in scope, also expose
`POST /api/abuse/report/<reportId>/clip` accepting a multipart
file. v1 can ignore that and just store the text report.

---

## 10. Record meeting — ❌ Backend endpoints missing

The Host Controls panel exposes a "Record Meeting" toggle. The FE
already calls these endpoints (via `RecordingRepository`):

```
POST /api/recording/start/<meetingCode>
POST /api/recording/stop/<meetingCode>
GET  /api/recording/<meetingCode>
```

Live server returns **404** for both `start` and `stop`:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud/api/recording/start/jhmyqrneac
# → HTTP/2 404 Not Found
```

### Required backend changes

This is the largest piece of work — recording typically needs:

- A worker process that joins the room as a "recorder bot"
  (mediasoup consumer for every producer) and writes a composed
  video to disk / S3.
- A control plane endpoint:
  - `POST /api/recording/start/<meetingCode>` → spin up the
    recorder, return `{ "status": "recording", "recordingId": "<uuid>" }`
  - `POST /api/recording/stop/<meetingCode>` → tear down the
    recorder, return `{ "status": "stopped", "url": "https://..." }`
  - `GET /api/recording/<meetingCode>` → list recordings for
    this room (returned objects need at least `id`, `url`,
    `startedAt`, `endedAt`, `durationSeconds`).
- A signed-URL upload endpoint if you want the mobile recorder to
  upload directly. Lower priority — server-side compositing is
  simpler.

If recording is not on the v1 roadmap, please **hide the toggle in
Host Controls** (or grey it out with a "Coming soon" subtitle) so
hosts don't think it's broken when it actually doesn't exist.

---

## Test plan (after backend changes ship)

```bash
# 1. Chat REST works
curl -i -X POST https://mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud/api/chat/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"meetingId":"jhmyqrneac","senderId":"<id>","senderName":"X","content":"probe"}'
# → expected:  201 Created

# 2. Chat history CORS
curl -i -H "Origin: https://mizdah-front.ogoul.cloud" \
  https://mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud/api/chat/jhmyqrneac?userId=<id>
# → expected:  Access-Control-Allow-Origin response header present

# 3. Report abuse endpoint
curl -i -X POST https://mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud/api/abuse/report \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reporterId":"<id>","type":"Spam","names":"alice","description":"t"}'
# → expected:  200 OK, body includes "reportId"

# 4. Recording start
curl -i -X POST https://mizdah-backend.ogoul.cloud/api/recording/start/jhmyqrneac
# → expected:  200 OK, body includes "status":"recording"

# 5. Host controls — connect via socket.io and verify
#    lock-meeting, mute-all, update-settings, end-meeting-for-all
#    are all honoured + force-mute / host-changed-permission /
#    join-denied are emitted to peers when appropriate.
```

## 11. Emoji reactions — protocol clarification

The mobile and web clients were not seeing each other's emoji
reactions. Root cause was a contract mismatch — the web client
sends reactions through `broadcast-data` (the catch-all bucket
for everything that isn't CHAT / MEDIA_TOGGLE / SYNC_STATE /
RECORDING_PERMISSION_UPDATE), and listens on
`broadcast-data-remote`. Mobile was emitting `send-reaction` and
listening on `receive-reaction` / `reaction-received` / `reaction`.

The mobile client (this PR) now ALSO uses the web's contract.

### Wire format

**Client → server (sender):**
```json
socket.emit("broadcast-data", {
  "meetingId": "<code>",
  "type": "REACTION",
  "reaction": {
    "id":        "<sender-socket-id>-<timestamp>",
    "emoji":     "🎉",
    "timestamp": 1714738800123
  },
  "name":   "<displayName>",
  "userId": "<userId>"
})
```

**Server → other clients (receiver):**
```json
socket.on("broadcast-data-remote", { from, type, reaction, ... })
```

### Required backend behaviour

If the server already implements the generic `broadcast-data` →
`broadcast-data-remote` relay (the web client depends on it for
non-chat events), reactions work with no further change. Verify:

- `broadcast-data` from any peer is fanned out to every OTHER
  socket in the same room as `broadcast-data-remote`
- Server adds the sender's `socket.id` as `from` on the relayed
  payload
- Server does NOT echo back to the sender (mobile filters its
  own echoes by socket.id but the web client does not, so an
  echo would cause duplicate floating reactions there)

If the relay is missing, please add it. It's the same pattern as
`media-toggle` → `media-toggle-remote` so should be a small
copy-paste in the signaling handler.

The legacy `send-reaction` → `receive-reaction` relay used by
older Flutter builds is no longer required for cross-platform.
You can drop it at your convenience — mobile will fall back to
the broadcast-data path.

## Frontend changes shipping in this PR

The mobile client (commit pending) makes the following changes
that work TODAY against the existing backend:

- **Report abuse**: submit button now calls
  `SettingsRepository.sendFeedback()` (`/api/meeting/feedback`).
  Will switch over to `/api/abuse/report` once that endpoint
  exists. Errors are surfaced to the user instead of pretending
  success.
- **On the go**: implements a real compact-mode UI rather than
  the snackbar — toggling the option flips the meeting screen
  into a large-button audio-first layout suitable for use while
  moving. No backend involvement.
- **Screen share**: routes through `SFUService.produceScreen` so
  the screen video reaches other peers via mediasoup. No backend
  change.

After the backend changes documented above ship, no further
mobile redeploy is needed for: chat REST, abuse reporting, host
control enforcement, recording start/stop. Mobile will pick up the
new behaviour automatically.
